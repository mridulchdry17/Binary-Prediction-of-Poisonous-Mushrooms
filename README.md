#Binary Prediction of Poisonous Mushrooms
This repository contains code and analysis for the <b>Binary Prediction of Poisonous Mushrooms</b> competition. The dataset is derived from a deep learning model trained on the UCI Mushroom dataset, with feature distributions that closely match but are not identical to the original. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a mushroom is edible (<b>e</b>) or poisonous (<b>p</b>).<br><br>

Dataset Description
<b>Train dataset</b>: Contains the features and the binary target (<b>class</b>), which indicates whether a mushroom is edible (<b>e</b>) or poisonous (<b>p</b>).<br>
<b>Test dataset</b>: Contains the features without the target class. Your objective is to predict the target class for each row in this dataset.<br>
<b>Sample Submission</b>: A file showing the correct format for submissions.<br><br>
<b>Note</b>: This dataset includes categorical values that may not match those found in the original UCI Mushroom dataset. Participants need to handle these discrepancies as part of their model development.<br><br>
